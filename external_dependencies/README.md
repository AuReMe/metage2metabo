# M2M - External dependencies
This folder contains dependicies of Metage2Metabo that are not available elsewhere.
This includes:

- ``CyOog``: a package for [version 2.8.2 of Cytoscape](http://chianti.ucsd.edu/Cyto-2%5F8%5F2/) to visualize Power Graphs (in bbl format) created by `m2m analysis`. The tool has been developed by [Royer et al. (2008)](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000108). It is no longer maintained by the authors and is provided as is.

- ``Oog_CommandLineTool2012``: a tool to visualize Power Graphs. It is used in `m2m analysis` to create svg file from Power Graph (in bbl format). The tool has been developed by [Royer et al. (2008)](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000108). It is no longer maintained by the authors and is provided as is. It is a jar file (``Oog.jar``) compiled for Java 6, so the system needs at least this version of Java.
