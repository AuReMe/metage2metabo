# M2M - External dependencies
This folder contains dependicies of Metage2Metabo that are not available elsewhere.
This includes:

- ``Oog_CommandLineTool2012``: a tool to visualize Power Graphs used in `m2m analysis`. The tool is presented in the following article: [Royer et al. (2008)](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000108). It is no longer maintained by the authors and is provided as is. It is a jar file (``Oog.jar``) compiled for Java 6, so the system needs at least this version of Java.
