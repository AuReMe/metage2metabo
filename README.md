# M2M - metage2metabo
Metage2metabo is a Python3 (Python >= 3.7, tested with 3.7 and 3.8) tool to perform graph-based metabolic analysis starting from annotated genomes (**reference genomes or metagenome-assembled genomes**). It uses *Pathway Tools* in a automatic and parallel way to **reconstruct metabolic networks** for a large number of genomes. The obtained metabolic networks are then **analyzed individually and collectively** in order to get the **added value of metabolic cooperation in microbiota over individual metabolism** and to **identify and screen interesting organisms** among all.


m2m can be used as a whole workflow (``` m2m workflow ```, ``` m2m metacom ```) or steps can be performed individually (``` m2m recon ``` , ``` m2m iscope ``` , ``` m2m cscope ```, ``` m2m addedvalue ```, ``` m2m mincom ```, ``` m2m seeds ```).

A dedicated pipeline for the analysis of minimal community solution and their visualisation in power graphs is available with `m2m analysis`. More details in the [documentation](https://metage2metabo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/m2m_analysis.html).

## General information about the modelling

M2M has two main dependencies for modelling metabolic networks: [MeneTools](https://github.com/cfrioux/MeneTools) and [Miscoto](https://github.com/cfrioux/miscoto). Accordingly metabolic models in M2M follow the producibility in metabolic networks as defined by the [network expansion](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15712108) algorithm.
Mainly, two rules are followed:
* a *recursive rule*: the products of a reactions are producible if **all** reactants of this reaction are themselves producible
* an *initiation rule*: producibility is initiated by the presence of nutrients, called *seeds*. 

A metabolite that is producible from a set of nutrients is described as being "in the scope of the seeds".
The computation is made using logic solvers (Answer Set Programming). The present modelling ignores the stoichiometry of reactions (2A + B --> C is considered equivalent to A + B --> C), and is therefore suited to non-curated or draft metabolic networks, as the ones built using M2M with the PathoLogic software of [Pathway Tools](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5036846/pdf/bbv079.pdf) handled by [Mpwt](https://github.com/AuReMe/mpwt). Many works have relied on network expansion to study organisms ([here](http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/tpj.12627), [here](https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000049) or [there](http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005276)) and communities ([here](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/34/17/i934/5093211), [here](https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12864-018-4786-7), or [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18546499)). It has been [compared](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19425125), [combined](https://www.cambridge.org/core/product/identifier/S1471068418000455/type/journal_article) to steady-state modelling (Flux Balance Analysis).

## License

This project is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License - see the [LICENSE.md](https://github.com/AuReMe/metage2metabo/blob/master/LICENSE) file for details.

## Documentation

A more detailled documentation is available at: [https://metage2metabo.readthedocs.io](https://metage2metabo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Technologies

Python 3 (Python 3.7 and 3.8 is tested). M2M uses a certain number of Python dependencies. An example of all these dependencies working for Ubuntu 18.04 is available in [requirements.txt](https://github.com/AuReMe/metage2metabo/blob/master/requirements.txt).
They can be installed with:
````sh
pip install -r requirements.txt --no-cache-dir
````
In particular, m2m relies on:
* [mpwt](https://github.com/AuReMe/mpwt) to automatize metabolic network reconstruction with Pathway Tools
* [padmet](https://github.com/AuReMe/padmet) to manage metabolic networks
* [menetools](https://github.com/cfrioux/MeneTools) to analyze individual metabolic capabilities using logic programming
* [miscoto](https://github.com/cfrioux/miscoto) to analyze collective metabolic capabilities and select communities within microbiota using logic programming

Also, m2m_analysis relies on other packages:
* [networkx](https://github.com/networkx/networkx) to create graph from miscoto results
* [ete3](https://github.com/etetoolkit/ete) to add taxonomy information on the graph if you used mpwt taxon file
* [powergrasp](https://github.com/Aluriak/PowerGrASP) to compress networkx graph

## Requirements

* [Pathway Tools](http://bioinformatics.ai.sri.com/ptools/) version 23.0 or higher (free for [academic users](https://biocyc.org/download-bundle.shtml)) is **required for m2m workflow and m2m recon**.  Metage2Metabo uses mpwt for multiprocessing and mpwt is not usable on Windows. Therefore, the reconstruction step of Metage2Metabo **is not available on Windows**.
    * Pathway Tools requirements
        * **Linux**: Gnome terminal and Libxm4
        ```sh
        apt-get update && apt-get install gnome-terminal libxm4
         ```
        * **All OS**: [NCBI Blast](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK279671/) and a ncbirc file in user's home directory
            * Install with apt-get
            ```sh
            apt-get update && apt-get install gnome-terminal libxm4 ncbi-blast+ 
            echo "[ncbi]\nData=/usr/bin/data" > ~/.ncbirc
            ```
            * Install with a [dmg installer](ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/executables/blast+/LATEST/) on MacOS
    * Pathway Tools install
        * **Linux**
        ```sh
        chmod +x ./pathway-tools-22.5-linux-64-tier1-install 
        ./pathway-tools-22.5-linux-64-tier1-install 
        ```
        and follow the instructions during the interactive install

        *For a silent install*: ```./pathway-tools-22.5-linux-64-tier1-install --InstallDir your/install/directory/pathway-tools --PTOOLS_LOCAL_PATH your/chosen/directory/for/data/ptools --InstallDesktopShortcuts 0 --mode unattended```
        * **MacOS**

        Dmg installer with a graphical interface.

        * **Warning** 
    
        /!\ For all OS, Pathway Tools must be in ```$PATH```. 
        On Linux and MacOS: ```export PATH=$PATH:your/install/directory/pathway-tools```. 
        Consider adding Pathway Tools in ```$PATH``` permanently by running
        ````sh
        echo 'export PATH="$PATH:your/install/directory/pathway-tools:"' >> ~/.bashrc
        ````

* [Oog Power Graph Command line tool](https://github.com/AuReMe/metage2metabo/tree/master/external_dependencies/Oog_CommandLineTool2012) to create a svg file from the compressed graph at the end of m2m_analysis. This tool is a jar file (``Oog.jar``) so Java is needed to use it.

## Installation

Developed and tested on Linux (Ubuntu, Fedora, Debian) and MacOs (version 10.14) with Python3.7.

Continuous Integration using GitHub Actions with Python3.7 and Python3.8 on ubuntu-latest, macos-latest and windows-latest ([corresponding virtual environment](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/specifications-for-github-hosted-runners#supported-runners-and-hardware-resources)).

### Installation with pip

```
pip install Metage2Metabo
```

### Availability on Docker and Singularity

Due to Pathway-Tools license, Docker or Singularity images are not available publicly.

But you can create these images by using the Dockerfile and Singularity recipes available inside the recipes folder.
With these files, you can create container with Pathway-Tools and m2m.

More informations in the [Docker and Singularity Documentation](https://metage2metabo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html#installation-with-docker).

## Analysis of the minimal solutions

M2M performs a community minimization to find the union and intersection of the minimal communities. But it is possible to analyze all the minimal communities.
M2M has a second command-line, named m2m_analysis that performs this analysis. This method is slower than m2m as all sollutions are enumerated.
Then it creates a solutions graph and compresses it in a powergraph. Then it creates visualization (html file and optionnaly svg files).

More information about this command in the [m2m_analysis Documentation](https://metage2metabo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/m2m_analysis.html).
